# Shopping Cart

### Description

This program allows users to add items to their shopping cart from a list of products. When the user clicks on an item, the number of that item in stock will decrement by one and the item will be added to the shopping cart. When there are no more of a particular item, that item can no longer be added to the shopping cart. The shopping cart keeps track of each item and the order in which they were placed into the shopping cart.

### How to Run

1. Download the zip file in github and navigate to the **Shopping-Cart-Early-main** directory in the terminal.
2. Run `http-server -c-1`.
3. When that is complete, load **localhost:8080** in the browser and click on the link for **standalone.html**. This will load the project in the browser.
4. Click the buttons to add items to your cart.

### Roadmap of Future Improvements

- **Remove from Shopping Cart:** I plan to improve the functionality of the shopping cart to allow the user to remove items from the shopping cart and return them to the product list by clicking on the item in the shopping cart.
- **Styling:** I plan to improve the styling of the buttons on the page as well as adding pictures for each of the products in the product line and in the shopping cart.
